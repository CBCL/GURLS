A step by step guide to get the code working (for both IKL and MKL)

1. Check if everyhting works already

   simply type "make test" , if there is no error occuring the
   code already works. Jump to 5.)

2. Check whether LIBSVM works. 

   Type "make libsvm_test". If this test does NOT end with
   the message "Test passed" first ckeck whether all shared libraries are present 
   ldd libsvm/libsvm_classifier.mexglx (32bit)
   ldd libsvm/libsvm_classifier.mexa64 (64bit)
   You may need to recompile the libsvm file. Go to the libsvm/ directory  
   modify the Makefile to your system. Now type "make".

3. Check whether all mex files for IKL are there
   
   If "make Kbeta_test" or "make subprob_test" do NOT end with 
   the message "Test passed" you need to recompile them. 
   Adjust the Makefile and type "make".

4. If point 2. and 3. work it is probably Ipopt which is missing

   Try "make ipopt_test". If this does NOT end with the message 
   "Test passed" ipopt is not working.
 
   We provided 32bit and 64bit precompiled versions of ipopt in 
   the ipopt directory. Make sure the correct lib directories for your 
   machine are in the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH . Make sure there are no 
   missing shared libraries by typeing (on 32bit machine)
   ldd ipopt/ipopt-3.3.5-mumps-i686/matlab/ipopt.mexglx
   Install the missing shared libraries and test "make ipopt_test" again. 
  
   If this does not work you may need to compile your own version 
   of Ipopt which can be found at this website 
   https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt
   (If you comiple a version for Windows with the MUMPS solver please 
   send me the binary so I can include it, Thanks!)
   
5. Everything works. Now start matlab and try chessboard_example. Have fun
