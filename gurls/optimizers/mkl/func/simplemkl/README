Matlab implementation of Infinite Kernel Learning and SimpleMKL

1. Installation
===============
   Please read the file INSTALL for a step by step guide for 
   installing the software. 

2. SimpleMKL
============
   There is a matlab script "simplemkl_example" which contains an
   example of how the code is used. Also try "help simplemkl" and 
   check out the scripts run_demo32.sh and run_demo64.sh (the first one
   for a 32bit machine, the latter for a 64bit machine)

3. Infinite Kernel Learning
===========================
   There is a matlab script "ikl_example" with an example run of 
   the algorithm. Also try "help IKLmain" and 
   check out the scripts run_demo32.sh and run_demo64.sh (the first one
   for a 32bit machine, the latter for a 64bit machine)
